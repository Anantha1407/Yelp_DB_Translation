Project:
For our project, my teammate and I are tasked with translating Yelp's JSON dataset into 
Arango database format using Python scripts and loading it into Arango DB. I'll be 
handling the data pre-processing, database schema design, and ETL development 
using Python. This means I'll be responsible for extracting data from the JSON files, 
transforming it into the appropriate format, and loading it into the Arango database.
Meanwhile, my teammate will focus on data analysis, visualization, and reporting. 
They'll leverage the structured data in the Arango database to perform various analyses, 
such as identifying popular business categories in specific locations or trends in 
customer preferences. Additionally, they will visualize the analysis results 
communicate the insights derived from the data. Also some analysis will be carried out 
together.
This division of work allows us to efficiently tackle both the technical aspects of data 
transformation and loading as well as the analytical tasks to derive meaningful insights 
from the Yelp dataset.
